zip-export-media
================

An in-progress Drupal module that exports files attached to nodes with Media fields as a Zip file.

I developed this module for a specific use case on a client site. I intend to make it more flexible and contribute it to drupal.org.

In the meantime, you can contact me at info@[myhandle].com, via Twitter (@fureigh) or through drupal.org: https://drupal.org/user/111437/.
